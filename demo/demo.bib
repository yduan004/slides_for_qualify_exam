              candidates for new indications in diabetes treatment by mining
              clinical 'omics' data. We analyzed data from genome wide
              association studies (GWAS), proteomics and metabolomics studies
              and revealed a total of 992 proteins as potential anti-diabetic
              targets in human. Information on the drugs that target these 992
              proteins was retrieved from the Therapeutic Target Database (TTD)
              and 108 of these proteins are drug targets with drug projects
              information. Research and preclinical drug targets were excluded
              and 35 of the 108 proteins were selected as druggable proteins.
              Among them, five proteins were known targets for treating
              diabetes. Based on the pathogenesis knowledge gathered from the
              OMIM and PubMed databases, 12 protein targets of 58 drugs were
              found to have a new indication for treating diabetes. CMap
              (connectivity map) was used to compare the gene expression
              patterns of cells treated by these 58 drugs and that of cells
              treated by known anti-diabetic drugs or diabetes risk causing
              compounds. As a result, 9 drugs were found to have the potential
              to treat diabetes. Among the 9 drugs, 4 drugs (diflunisal,

              ADRA2A (Alpha-2A adrenergic receptor) had a new indication for
              treating type 2 diabetes. These findings indicated that 'omics'

              tool to discover novel anti-diabetic indications from marketed
              drugs and clinical candidates. Furthermore, the results of our

              susceptibility. In this study, we have identified pathways that
              stimulate differentiation of bone forming osteoblasts from human
              mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs). Gene expression profiling was
              performed in hMSCs differentiated toward osteoblasts (at 6 h).
              Significantly regulated genes were analyzed in silico, and the
              Connectivity Map (CMap) was used to identify candidate bone
              stimulatory compounds. The signature of parbendazole matches the
              expression changes observed for osteogenic hMSCs. Parbendazole
              stimulates osteoblast differentiation as indicated by increased
              alkaline phosphatase activity, mineralization, and up-regulation
              of bone marker genes (alkaline phosphatase/ALPL,
              osteopontin/SPP1, and bone sialoprotein II/IBSP) in a subset of
              the hMSC population resistant to the apoptotic effects of
              parbendazole. These osteogenic effects are independent of
              glucocorticoids because parbendazole does not up-regulate
              glucocorticoid receptor (GR) target genes and is not inhibited by
              the GR antagonist mifepristone. Parbendazole causes profound
              cytoskeletal changes including degradation of microtubules and
              increased focal adhesions. Stabilization of microtubules by
              pretreatment with Taxol inhibits osteoblast differentiation.
              Parbendazole up-regulates bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2)
              gene expression and activity. Cotreatment with the BMP-2
              antagonist DMH1 limits, but does not block, parbendazole-induced
              mineralization. Using the CMap we have identified a previously
              unidentified lineage-specific, bone anabolic compound,
              parbendazole, which induces osteogenic differentiation through a
              combination of cytoskeletal changes and increased BMP-2 activity.",

              Reduced amount of functional survival motor neuron (SMN) protein
              due to mutations or deletion in the SMN1 gene is the cause of
              SMA. A potential treatment strategy for SMA is to upregulate
              levels of SMN protein originating from the SMN2 gene compensating
              in part for the absence of functional SMN1 gene. Although there
              exists a sizeable literature on SMN2 inducing compounds, there is
              comparatively less known about the signaling pathways which

              elevated serum levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
              cholesterol in patients with coronary heart disease is
              beneficial, there are few data to guide decisions about therapy
              for patients whose primary lipid abnormality is a low level of
              high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. METHODS: We conducted
              a double-blind trial comparing gemfibrozil (1200 mg per day) with
              placebo in 2531 men with coronary heart disease, an HDL
              cholesterol level of 40 mg per deciliter (1.0 mmol per liter) or
              less, and an LDL cholesterol level of 140 mg per deciliter (3.6
              mmol per liter) or less. The primary study outcome was nonfatal
              myocardial infarction or death from coronary causes. RESULTS: The
              median follow-up was 5.1 years. At one year, the mean HDL
              cholesterol level was 6 percent higher, the mean triglyceride
              level was 31 percent lower, and the mean total cholesterol level
              was 4 percent lower in the gemfibrozil group than in the placebo
              group. LDL cholesterol levels did not differ significantly
              between the groups. A primary event occurred in 275 of the 1267
              patients assigned to placebo (21.7 percent) and in 219 of the
              1264 patients assigned to gemfibrozil (17.3 percent). The overall
              reduction in the risk of an event was 4.4 percentage points, and
              the reduction in relative risk was 22 percent (95 percent
              confidence interval, 7 to 35 percent; P=0.006). We observed a 24
              percent reduction in the combined outcome of death from coronary
              heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and stroke (P<
              0.001). There were no significant differences in the rates of
              coronary revascularization, hospitalization for unstable angina,
              death from any cause, and cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Gemfibrozil
              therapy resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of major
              cardiovascular events in patients with coronary disease whose
              primary lipid abnormality was a low HDL cholesterol level. The
              findings suggest that the rate of coronary events is reduced by
              raising HDL cholesterol levels and lowering levels of
              triglycerides without lowering LDL cholesterol levels.",

              genomic tools in pharmacology and toxicology, offers a promising
              enhancement to traditional methods of target
              identification/validation, lead identification, efficacy
              evaluation, and toxicity assessment. To realize the value of
              chemogenomics information, a contextual database is needed to
              relate the physiological outcomes induced by diverse compounds to
              the gene expression patterns measured in the same animals.
              Massively parallel gene expression characterization coupled with
              traditional assessments of drug candidates provides additional,
              important mechanistic information, and therefore a means to
              increase the accuracy of critical decisions. A large-scale
              chemogenomics database developed from in vivo treated rats
              provides the context and supporting data to enhance and
              accelerate accurate interpretation of mechanisms of toxicity and
              pharmacology of chemicals and drugs. To date, approximately 600
              different compounds, including more than 400 FDA approved drugs,
              60 drugs approved in Europe and Japan, 25 withdrawn drugs, and
              100 toxicants, have been profiled in up to 7 different tissues of
              rats (representing over 3200 different drug-dose-time-tissue
              combinations). Accomplishing this task required evaluating and
              improving a number of in vivo and microarray protocols, including
              over 80 rigorous quality control steps. The utility of pairing
              clinical pathology assessments with gene expression data is
              illustrated using three anti-neoplastic drugs: carmustine,
              methotrexate, and thioguanine, which had similar effects on the
              blood compartment, but diverse effects on hepatotoxicity. We will
              demonstrate that gene expression events monitored in the liver
              can be used to predict pathological events occurring in that
              tissue as well as in hematopoietic tissues.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease and mental health both hold
              enormous public health importance, both ranking highly in results
              of the recent Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010). For
              the first time, the GBD 2010 has systematically and
              quantitatively assessed major depression as an independent risk
              factor for the development of ischemic heart disease (IHD) using
              comparative risk assessment methodology. METHODS: A pooled
              relative risk (RR) was calculated from studies identified through
              a systematic review with strict inclusion criteria designed to
              provide evidence of independent risk factor status. Accepted case
              definitions of depression include diagnosis by a clinician or by
              non-clinician raters adhering to Diagnostic and Statistical
              Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) or International Classification
              of Diseases (ICD) classifications. We therefore refer to the
              exposure in this paper as major depression as opposed to the
              DSM-IV category of major depressive disorder (MDD). The
              population attributable fraction (PAF) was calculated using the
              pooled RR estimate. Attributable burden was calculated by
              multiplying the PAF by the underlying burden of IHD estimated as
              part of GBD 2010. RESULTS: The pooled relative risk of developing
              IHD in those with major depression was 1.56 (95\% CI 1.30 to
              1.87). Globally there were almost 4 million estimated IHD
              disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), which can be attributed
              to major depression in 2010; 3.5 million years of life lost and
              250,000 years of life lived with a disability. These findings
              highlight a previously underestimated mortality component of the
              burden of major depression. As a proportion of overall IHD
              burden, 2.95\% (95\% CI 1.48 to 4.46\%) of IHD DALYs were
              estimated to be attributable to MDD in 2010. Eastern Europe and
              North Africa/Middle East demonstrate the highest proportion with
              Asia Pacific, high income representing the lowest. CONCLUSIONS:
              The present work comprises the most robust systematic review of
              its kind to date. The key finding that major depression may be
              responsible for approximately 3\% of global IHD DALYs warrants
              assessment for depression in patients at high risk of developing
              IHD or at risk of a repeat IHD event.",

              identified single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations with
              longevity. RESULTS: In our meta-analysis, we found suggestive

              Vitexin showed potent lifespan extensive activity and it elevated

              a routine task in functional genomics studies. However, currently
              widely used ORA tools employ statistical methods such as Fisher's
              exact test that reduce a pathway into a list of genes, ignoring
              the constitutive functional non-equivalent roles of genes and the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The longevity of an organism is influenced by both
              genetic and environmental factors. With respect to genetic
              factors, a significant effort is being made to identify
              pharmacological agents that extend life span by targeting
              pathways with a defined role in the aging process. On the
              environmental side, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the
              positive influence of interventions such as dietary restriction
              are being explored. The environment experienced by humans in
              modern societies already contains countless compounds that may
              influence longevity. Understanding the role played by common
              compounds that substantially affect the aging process will be
              critical for predicting and interpreting the outcome of
              introducing new interventions. Caffeine is the most widely used
              psychoactive drug worldwide. Prior studies in flies, worms, and
              mice indicate that caffeine may positively impact age-associated
              neurodegenerative pathology, such as that observed in Alzheimer's
              disease. RESULTS: Here we report that caffeine is capable of
              extending life span and improving healthspan in Caenorhabditis
              elegans, a finding that is in agreement with a recently published
              screen looking for FDA-approved compounds capable of extending
              worm life span. Life span extension using caffeine displays
              epistatic interaction with two known longevity interventions:
              dietary restriction and reduced insulin signaling. Caffeine
              treatment also delays pathology in a nematode model of
              polyglutamine disease. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of
              caffeine as a relevant factor in aging and healthspan in worms,
              combined with prior work in both humans and rodents linking
              caffeine consumption to reduced risk of age-associated disease,
              suggests that caffeine may target conserved longevity pathways.
              Further, it may be important to consider caffeine consumption
              when developing clinical interventions, particularly those
              designed to mimic dietary restriction or modulate
              insulin/IGF-1-like signaling. The positive impact of caffeine on
              a worm model of polyglutamine disease suggests that chronic
              caffeine consumption may generally enhance resistance to
              proteotoxic stress and may be relevant to assessing risk and
              developing treatments for human diseases like Alzheimer's and
              Huntington's disease. Future work addressing the relevant targets
              of caffeine in models of aging and healthspan will help to
              clarify the underlying mechanisms and potentially identify new
              molecular targets for disease intervention.",

              cholesterol (HDL-C) is a major risk factor for coronary heart
              disease (CHD). A secondary prevention study, the Veterans Affairs
              High-Density Lipoprotein Intervention Trial (VA-HIT),
              demonstrated that CHD events were significantly reduced during a
              median follow-up of 5.1 years by treating patients with the
              fibric acid derivative gemfibrozil when the predominant lipid
              abnormality was low HDL-C. OBJECTIVE: To determine if the
              reduction in major CHD events with gemfibrozil in VA-HIT could be
              attributed to changes in major plasma lipid levels. DESIGN:
              Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
              conducted from September 1991 to August 1998. SETTING: The
              Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program, in
              which 20 VA medical centers were participating sites.
              PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2531 men with a history of CHD who had
              low HDL-C levels (mean, 32 mg/dL [0.83 mmol/L] ) and low
              low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (mean, 111
              mg/dL [2.88 mmol/L]). INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly
              assigned to receive gemfibrozil, 1200 mg/d (n = 1264), or
              matching placebo (n = 1267). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Relation of
              lipid levels at baseline and averaged during the first 18 months
              of gemfibrozil treatment with the combined incidence of nonfatal
              myocardial infarction and CHD death. RESULTS: Concentrations of
              HDL-C were inversely related to CHD events. Multivariable Cox
              proportional hazards analysis showed that CHD events were reduced
              by 11\% with gemfibrozil for every 5-mg/dL (0.13-mmol/L) increase
              in HDL-C (P =.02). Events were reduced even further with
              gemfibrozil beyond that explained by increases in HDL-C values,
              particularly in the second through fourth quintiles of HDL-C
              values during treatment. During gemfibrozil treatment, only the
              increase in HDL-C significantly predicted a lower risk of CHD
              events; by multivariable analysis, neither triglyceride nor LDL-C
              levels at baseline or during the trial predicted CHD events.
              CONCLUSIONS: Concentrations of HDL-C achieved with gemfibrozil
              treatment predicted a significant reduction in CHD events in
              patients with low HDL-C levels. However, the change in HDL-C

              constitutive non-equivalence of various genes within a defined
              pathway. We here designed a network-based method to determine
              such non-equivalence in terms of gene weights. The gene weights
              determined are biologically consistent and robust to network
              perturbations. By integrating the gene weights into the classical
              gene set analysis, with a subsequent correction for the
              ``over-counting'' bias associated with multi-subunit proteins, we
              have developed a novel gene-weighed pathway analysis approach, as
              implemented in an R package called ``Gene Associaqtion
              Network-based Pathway Analysis'' (GANPA). Through analysis of
              several microarray datasets, including the p53 dataset, asthma
              dataset and three breast cancer datasets, we demonstrated that
              our approach is biologically reliable and reproducible, and
              therefore helpful for microarray data interpretation and

               data are obtained, they have emerged as the preferred
               methodology among statisticians and researchers performing data
               analysis. Today, these highly efficient techniques are being
               applied to an ever-widening variety of experimental designs in
               the social, behavioral, biological, and physical sciences. This
               long-awaited Second Edition of Myles Hollander and Douglas A.
               Wolfe's successful Nonparametric Statistical Methods meets the
               needs of a new generation of users, with completely up-to-date
               coverage of this important statistical area. Like its highly
               acclaimed predecessor, the revised edition, along with its
               companion ftp site, aims to equip students with the conceptual
               and technical skills necessary to select and apply the
               appropriate procedures for a given situation. An extensive array
               of examples drawn from actual experiments illustrates clearly
               how to use nonparametric approaches to handle one- or two-sample
               location and dispersion problems, dichotomous data, and one-way
               and two-way layout problems. Rewritten and updated, this Second
               Edition now includes new or expanded coverage of: *
               Nonparametric regression methods. * The bootstrap. * Contingency
               tables and the odds ratio. * Life distributions and survival
               analysis. * Nonparametric methods for experimental designs. *
               More procedures, real-world data sets, and problems. *

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Many statistical tests have been proposed in recent
              years for analyzing gene expression data in terms of gene sets,
              usually from Gene Ontology. These methods are based on widely
              different methodological assumptions. Some approaches test
              differential expression of each gene set against differential
              expression of the rest of the genes, whereas others test each
              gene set on its own. Also, some methods are based on a model in
              which the genes are the sampling units, whereas others treat the
              subjects as the sampling units. This article aims to clarify the
              assumptions behind different approaches and to indicate a
              preferential methodology of gene set testing. RESULTS: We
              identify some crucial assumptions which are needed by the
              majority of methods. P-values derived from methods that use a
              model which takes the genes as the sampling unit are easily
              misinterpreted, as they are based on a statistical model that
              does not resemble the biological experiment actually performed.
              Furthermore, because these models are based on a crucial and
              unrealistic independence assumption between genes, the P-values
              derived from such methods can be wildly anti-conservative, as a
              simulation experiment shows. We also argue that methods that
              competitively test each gene set against the rest of the genes
              create an unnecessary rift between single gene testing and gene
              set testing.",
